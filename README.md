# React Native Calendars 🗓️ 📆
![Node.js CI](https://github.com/dylmye/react-native-calendars/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

This module includes various customizable **React-Native** calendar components.

The package is both **Android** and **iOS** compatible.

The aim of this fork is to implement the following (in no particular order):
* A transition to functional components with hooks to improve performance
* The ability to replace marked dates with a font-awesome icon or custom text/component
* Any useful PRs from upstream
* Semantic versioning

## Installation

```
$ yarn add react-native-calendars
```

The solution is implemented in JavaScript so no native module linking is required.

## Usage

**Usage and API docs are available from upstream, [here](https://github.com/wix/react-native-calendars/blob/master/README.md#usage)**
